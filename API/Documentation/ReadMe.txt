To build database with Entity framework for the server configured in the appsettings.json file

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
2. Select the project that contains your DbContext class in the "Default project" dropdown.
3. Run the following command to create a migration:
   ```
   Add-Migration InitialCreate
   ```
   4. Run the following command to apply the migration and create the database:
   ```
   Update-Database
   ```
   5. If you want to create a new migration after making changes to your model, repeat steps 3 and 4.
   6. If you want to remove the last migration, run the following command:
   ```
   Remove-Migration
   ```
   7. If you want to remove the last migration and revert the database to the previous state, run the following command:
   ```
   Update-Database -Migration:PreviousMigrationName
   ```
   8. If you want to remove all migrations and start fresh, run the following command:
   ```
   Update-Database -Migration:0
   ```
   9. If you want to remove all migrations and delete the database, run the following command:
   ```
   Drop-Database
   ```
   10. If you want to create a new database with a different name, change the connection string in the appsettings.json file and repeat steps 3 and 4.
   11. If you want to seed the database with initial data, create a new class that implements ISeeder and add it to the DbContext's OnModelCreating method.
   12. If you want to use a different database provider, install the appropriate NuGet package and update the DbContext's OnConfiguring method.
   13. If you want to use a different database server, update the connection string in the appsettings.json file.
   14. If you want to use a different database name, update the connection string in the appsettings.json file.
   15. If you want to use a different database user, update the connection string in the appsettings.json file.
   16. If you want to use a different database password, update the connection string in the appsettings.json file.
   17. If you want to use a different database port, update the connection string in the appsettings.json file.
